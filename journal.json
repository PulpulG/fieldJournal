        "text": "Turned in late last night—around 1 a.m.—after another long session with the liquid simulation in P5.js. Version 008 is now alive, still shifting, still mutating. I'm learning that more motion sometimes comes from less force; slowing the drops seems to reveal currents I wasn't seeing before.\n\nDrove my girlfriend across the border to San Diego for work. On the way back I kept thinking about the project, about how this “liquidSim” keeps becoming its own little world. I'm also still trying to get my work out there—wandering through Web3 platforms, looking for commissions, trying to connect with anyone who resonates with this strange digital fluid I keep chasing."

Our gas line got cut off unexpectedly, so the evening shifted into troubleshooting mode.\n\nLater, Luis (Happysnacks) stopped by—a fellow glitch explorer. We talked about broken pixels and emergent AI tools, about how we’re both trying to carve a space where our art can actually sustain us. We circled back to our shared project, Liquid Glitch, imagining live streams, cross-platform experiments, and whatever else might help us reach people—and maybe, finally, make a living doing what moves us."
