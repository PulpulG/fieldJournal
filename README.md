READ ME — FIELD NOTES, VOL. 0

This repository is the first waypoint in a long trail of digital wanderings.
Inside these files lies the beginning of a journal… not quite a newsletter yet,
not quite a map either, but something in between. A record of experiments,
late-night code rituals, and the slow emergence of a project that refuses 
to stay still.

You are looking at the earliest traces of a dispatch system—messages sent 
from the edges of glitch, liquid simulations, border crossings, and whatever 
else happens to drift into view on any given day.

Every entry in journal.json is a coordinate.
Every timestamp is a breadcrumb.
Every line of code is a compass needle, twitching toward something 
still unnamed.

This is where the story starts.
A field journal in motion.
A newsletter in incubation.
A signal from the small hours.

If you’ve found your way here,
welcome to the beginning.
